# Code Guides
## How to execute tutorials interactively
The guides are build using [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org) and [Bash kernel](https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel). For easiest work with guides it's advised to install Jupyter, checkout the tutorial and run the code interactively.

## Guides:
- Installation of tezos and liquidity from sources
    - [MacOS](macos-tezos.ipynb)
