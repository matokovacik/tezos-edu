    "## Development of Smart Contracts\n",
    "At this point we have all prerequisites for preparing contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "Smart contracts for Tezos are implemented and using Michelson language. It's low-level stack-based language. We will refer to Michelson in other sections of this guide. We will implement sample contract using high level language Liquidity. Liquidity is provided with command line utility, that can be used to compile, deploy and manage the contracts developed using Liquidity language. Liquidity compiles into Michelson. All features, that are available in Michelson are possible in Liquidity as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquidity is a language heavily inspired by the OCaml language. Before starting working with Liquidity we advise \n",
    "to check some OCaml, F# or ReasonML tutorials to familiarize with language syntax (eg. https://try.ocamlpro.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Liquidity, refer to [Liquidity website](http://www.liquidity-lang.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Calculator Contract\n",
    "For beginning we will implement sample contract, that will be managing state and will enable add and subtract operations. Default operation will be add.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart contracts are software programs that binds the parties involved in a transaction to an agreement with out any third party being involved. The smart contract on the blockchain guarantees that nothing can be changed about the agreement without the consent of all the parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you deploy smart contract into the blockchain it cannot be changed. It prescribes how it's internal storage should be ammended. When smart contract is called, all resulting storage changes are verified agains the smart contract code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each smart contract in liquidity consists of four parts\n",
    "- version declaration (of liquidity)\n",
    "- storage definition\n",
    "- storage initialisation\n",
    "- entry functions (at least method main is required. This method is called when contract is executed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following code shows structure of our initial version of contract.\n",
    "\n",

    "Function marked with `let%init` represents initialisation function for the storage. The function should return storage data structure (in this case int). Returned value would be used as a initial storage value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function main is default entry point for contract. Entry points are taking parameters, storage and returning tuple with list of operations, that should be applied after the contract is executed and storage value after execution of the contract. In our case we are not returning any operations, just incrementing value of internal storage.\n",
