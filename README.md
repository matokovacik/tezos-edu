# Tezos/Blockchain Education Curriculum

The guide is focusing on developing dapp using Tezos Blockchain. Blockchain generic topics are refered, however not always elaborated further. We suggest to check articles and resources referenced to grasp generic concepts.

## Prerequisites
The tutorial focus on Tezos specifics. To successfully follow the course it's recommended to have following prerequisites.
1. You should understand how blockchain works at high level
2. You should be familiar with some programming language. Understanding of functional languages like Lisp, Scheme, Ocaml is a plus.
3. It's recommended to do some tutorials on Ocaml language - eg. https://try.ocamlpro.com
4. You should be confortable with command line and shell scripting.
