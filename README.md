# Tezos/Blockchain Education Curriculum

The guide is focusing on developing dapp using Tezos Blockchain. Blockchain generic topics are refered, however not always elaborated further. We suggest to check articles and resources referenced to grasp generic concepts.

For convenience reasons technical walk-through sections are using Jupyter Notebook with Bash Kernel. Please consult [how to get Jupyter installed](prework/jupyter_installation.md). If you look at the tutorial directly on github you can still do cut&paste to console even without Jupyter/bash kernel.
