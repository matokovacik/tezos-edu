# Tezos/Blockchain Education Curriculum

The guide is focusing on developing dapp using Tezos Blockchain. Blockchain generic topics are refered, however not always elaborated further. We suggest to check articles and resources referenced to grasp generic concepts.

## Hot to Read and Who Should Read The Guide
During the tutorial we will be marking content depending on the experience level using icons :hatching_chick: and :chicken:.
Guide is focusing on two experience levels of users 
- developers with no prior knowledge on blockain
- blockchain developers with experience with tezos/other platforms, that would like to get up to speed quickly.

Pages in contents bellow are designed to be followed step-by-step. In case you are advanced user(:chicken:) you can skip sections addressed to developers with no prior blockchain experience (:hatching_chick:).

Tutorial is using layering of concepts. In case you don't understand some command or concept, we will try to elaborate on in some of later section.



## Prerequisites
The tutorial focus on Tezos specifics. To successfully follow the course it's recommended to have following prerequisites.
1. You should understand how blockchain works at high level (we suggest to look at [High Level Blockchain Curriculum](generic/recommended_courses.md)])
2. You should be familiar with some programming language. Understanding of functional languages like Lisp, Scheme, Ocaml is a plus. It's recommended to do some tutorials on Ocaml language - eg. https://try.ocamlpro.com
3. You should be comfortable with command line and shell scripting - eg. https://www.learnshell.org . At the time of writing we've tested the samples on Debian (Raspberry) and Mac OS.
